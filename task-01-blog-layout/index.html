      <h2>Intro: A Quiet Start</h2>
      <p>There’s something sacred about the early hours—before the world fully wakes up. Over the past year, I’ve come to appreciate the calm and clarity that a mindful morning routine brings. It’s not perfect, but it’s mine.</p>

      <h2>What Works for Me</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Water First:</strong> I keep a bottle by my bed and drink it before I even check my phone.</li>
        <li><strong>Stretch & Breathe:</strong> A few minutes of movement and deep breathing helps me feel grounded.</li>
        <li><strong>Notebook Ritual:</strong> I jot down three things I’m grateful for and one intention for the day.</li>
        <li><strong>Quick Plan:</strong> I glance at my calendar and mentally prep for what’s ahead.</li>
      </ul>
